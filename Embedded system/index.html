        <p class="system_par">A system is an arrangement in which all its unit assemble work together according to a set
            of rules. It can
            also be defined as a way of working, organizing or doing one or many tasks according to a fixed plan. For
            example, a watch is a time displaying system. Its components follow a set of rules to show time. If one of
            its parts fails, the watch will stop working. So we can say, in a system, all its subcomponents depend on
            each other.</p>

        <p class="embedded_par">As its name suggests, Embedded means something that is attached to another thing. An
            embedded system can be
            thought of as a computer hardware system having software embedded in it. An embedded system can be an
            independent system or it can be a part of a large system. An embedded system is a microcontroller or
            microprocessor based system which is designed to perform a specific task. For example, a fire alarm is an
            embedded system; it will sense only smoke</p>

        <p>To fulfill a function in an embedded environment, an Embedded System incorporates a robust motherboard inside
            an industrial enclosure, together with accompanying I/O (Input and Output) and Embedded OS Software. An
            Embedded Motherboard, which is the feature-rich tiny form factor core of an Embedded System, is the
            computing element. For the system to work, specialized I/O such as video capture, communication ports, and
            digital and analog signals are connected to the computer heart.</p>
